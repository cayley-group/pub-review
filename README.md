Brainstorming next-generation methods for biophysical simulation and biopolymer design

Christopher W. Beitel, Ph.D.

ABSTRACT

Here we primarily provide context for a discussion of several novel approaches towards advancing the state of the art in biophysical simulation. We begin with a discussion of various future-generation applications, for the sake of inspiration and directional effort, that could (at least some time this century) be reachable through advances in simulation and optimization capabilities. We then survey major trends in technology that present unique opportunities at this moment in history (i.e. what is different about 2021, technologically, that empowers us to solve this problem?). We subsequently review a selection of the most recent advances in the science of biophysical simulation to provide direct context for our discussion of several strategies to advance the science - with a focus on ways novel data sources could be integrated to beneficial effect.
