INTRODUCTION

At the nano-scale, the biological world is a vastly complex interaction of nano-machines that are encoded as linear polymers and subsequently (self-) assemble into their active machine forms. Thereafter, they are able to recognize targets, perform molecular transport, and facilitate chemical reactions - jetting about in a clockwork of precision and byzantine complexity. The ability to engineer at this scale is an important open problem in biology supposedly with the potential for far-reaching benefits across medicine, manufacturing, energy, materials, and the remediation of climate change.

In the course of designing engineering strategy, it is important to be both bold and specific about what we might like to accomplish in the long-term. For example, saying ‘we choose to go to the moon’ is both bold and specific. Here we begin with a free-spirited discussion of what will likely be accomplished some time this century as a result of advances in biophysical simulation technology. We begin in this way to stimulate and expand the intuition of the reader in the course of their imagining what should be required of the next generation of biophysical simulation tools. Not just any simulator will do and it is important to begin to draw a line backwards from dream goals towards specific engineering requirements.

Better sequencing and ubiquitous consumer biosensing. Engineered enzymes and structures are present in several next-generation sequencing systems including those of Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore. In both cases, engineered aspects of the polymerase and nanopore (respectively) affect attributes like polymer translation rate that in turn relate directly to the accuracy of sequencing data that results. Here, being able to engineer protein monomers and multimers that have desirable properties in how they handle DNA templates relates directly to the usefulness of those platforms for assaying the biodiversity of the natural world. Further, reducing the cost and scale of these while increasing their robustness opens the door to sequencer-like consumer products for the next generation of high-resolution biosensing and diagnostics. Imagine modern cell-free cancer detection techniques made cheap and reliable enough to be performed as routinely at every doctor’s visit as measuring your blood pressure or stepping on the scale.

Resolving proteopathy. Various diseases result from the misfolding or structural abnormality of proteins. The ability to predict folded structures from an individual’s genome data has diagnostic potential. Further the ability to efficiently simulate the steric changes to such proteins in the presence of artificial compounds could permit computational search over the possible space of such compounds to discover ones that recover the desired structure. In the case of misfolding, this could occur in the form of engineered chaperone proteins that facilitate proper folding but then are not subsequently present to hinder the natural activity of the protein.

Better (edge) manufacturing. The means to realistically simulate the behavior of complex metabolic systems in silico, in an efficient manner, could open the door to manufacturing pharmaceuticals or other important industrial compounds in a manner that is more efficient or reliable. For example, the simulation of manufacturing processes of a vaccine for coronavirus, along with its delivery system, could permit not only more vaccine to be manufactured with the same resources - it could open the door to novel manufacturing paradigms such as high-confidence manufacturing at the “edge” (within hospitals and vaccine delivery sites) avoiding the complex logistics required for delivery of doses that are manufactured at a centralized location.

Carbon sequestration. As the planet warms, technologies capable of capturing and safely sequestering carbon from the atmosphere are growing in potential relevance. For more than a decade, microalgae have been advocated as a potential means of performing such sequestration. The means to simulate enzyme systems could permit the enhancement of the efficiency or secondary usefulness of such systems (such as for energy production or manufacturing).

Self-assembly and clinical trials on a chip. Potential design of organ- and tissue-like self-assembling forms as well as microfluidic devices capable of simulating human biological contexts with such fidelity as to greatly reduce the time required to bring pharmaceutical drugs to market due to reductions in the time needed to predict safety and efficacy. Such a capability has the potential to function synergistically with the development of biophysical simulation capabilities that closely resemble natural contexts.

Table 1. Summary of optimization challenges by problem area.

As promised, this section contained a free-spirited outline of some of the long-term potential of biophysical simulation capabilities. So what can we draw from these in terms of requirements? Firstly, there is not a distinction in need between the means to simulate polymers themselves and to simulate the contexts in which they are meant to be used. Second, the speed, scale, and accuracy with which biologically realistic simulations can be performed relates fairly directly to usefulness for solving a wide variety of problems of profound social value. Notably this includes the ability to simulate multimers including biologically realistic kinetics of folded structures together with their substrates or interacting partners. Third, there seems to be a key role for the design and simulation of microfluidic systems in conjunction with the simulation of biological processes that occur within them.

Having explored what might be accomplished this century and having begun to examine core requirements we invite the reader to imagine throughout the rest of the document the possibility of contracting the aspiration of, in the above sense, going to the moon not this century but in this decade.
